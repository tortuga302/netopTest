I used XAMPP for database. The database is called vl_net and has a table called "books" wich can be found in the folder <b>db</b>. The user name required is root, with no password(empty string).
In cmd run "node serverapp.js"
In browser run localhost:8080
Tu update a book change the data in the field and click on the blue button in the right.
