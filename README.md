I used XAMPP for database. The database is called <b>vl_net</b> and has a table called <b>books</b> wich can be found in the folder <b>db</b>. The user name required is <b>root</b>, with no password(empty string).<br>
In cmd run "node serverapp.js"<br>
In browser run localhost:8080<br>
Tu update a book change the data in the field and click on the blue button in the right.
